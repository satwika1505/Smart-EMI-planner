About the Project:

Smart EMI Planner is a TypeScript-based interactive financial simulation tool that helps users calculate Equated Monthly Installments (EMIs) and explore repayment scenarios. 
While it does not connect to real-time banking data, it gives users a real-time simulation experience, allowing them to experiment with different loan parameters and instantly see the impact on their finances.
This tool empowers users to plan loans efficiently, understand repayment implications, and make informed financial decisions—without needing complex banking tools.
It’s a practical demonstration of interactive financial modeling using modern TypeScript workflows.


Features:
--> EMI Calculation: Quickly computes monthly payments based on principal, interest rate, and tenure.
--> Detailed Repayment Breakdown: Shows total interest and overall repayment amount for better financial understanding.
--> Real-Time Simulation: Users can adjust loan parameters and instantly visualize the effects on their EMIs.
--> Lightweight & Interactive: Runs entirely on the client-side with a smooth, responsive interface.

Tech Stack:
--> Frontend & Logic: TypeScript, HTML, CSS
--> Build Tool: Vite for project setup and bundling
--> Deployment: Vercel for live hosting
